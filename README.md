# About

This repo just contains the requirements for creating a Triangle in modern **OpenGL**. 



As this is my first dive into graphics programming, you'll notice my inclusion of comments within my code, and boy there is a lot. 

They are essentially there to explain what the hell is going on with each line of code. Sources like:



1. [docs.gl](https://docs.gl/)
2. [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)



These two sources are very helpful with the OpenGL learning experience!

Extra Info
----------

I also wanted to include that I've linked and used both *GLFW* and *GLEW* in this project. With *GLFW* handling the window opening rather than Win32 and *GLEW* handling to use the modern versions of OpenGL since for some reason Windows out of the box only supports OpenGL 1.1...   

Also this project is only really meant to compile in x86 (I've linked GLFW x86 instead of x64). Yeah that is about it for this project and this officially marks the beginning of my OpenGL journey!
